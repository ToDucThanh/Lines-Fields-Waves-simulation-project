Problem: 2 antennas with size (radius a1, a2, length l1, l2), 
operating at frequency f, 
input current I0 and distance R between the 2 antennas. 
Calculate power output S, Smax, transmit power Prad, efficiency E, 
orientation D , 
gain G of 2 antennas . 
Calculate received power at antenna 2 (using Friis formula).
